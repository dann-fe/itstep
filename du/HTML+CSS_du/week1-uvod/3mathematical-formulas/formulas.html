    <h1>Mathematical formulas</h1>
    <h3>Linear equations</h3>
    <p>Linear equations can be written in this form:</p>
    <p class="Equation">ax + b = 0</p>
    <p>Linear equations represent relationships between <span class="marked">variables</span> that result in
        straight-line graphs when plotted on a coordinate plane. They consist of terms involving variables raised to the
        first power and constants, enabling the expression of proportional relationships and providing a foundation for
        various <span class="marked">mathematical and real-world applications</span>. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
        consectetur, adipisicing elit. Quas dignissimos dolores laboriosam.</p>
    <h3>Quadratic equations</h3>
    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
    <p class="Equation">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</p>
    <p>Where <span class="marked">a, b, c</span> are known values and <span class="marked">x</span> is the variable or
        unknown. Also, <span class="marked">a</span> can't be 0.</p>
    <h3>The area of a circle (A)</h 3>
    <p><span class="marked">π</span> times the radius (<span class="marked">r</span>) squared. </p>
    <p class="Equation">π x r = A</p>
    <p>or, when you know the diameter <span class="marked">D</span></p>
    <p class="Equation">(π / 4) x D<sup>2</sup> = A</p>
    <p>or, when you know the circumference <span class="marked">C</span></p>
    <p class="Equation">C<sup>2</sup> / 4 x π</p>
    <h3>Intersection</h3>
    <p>An interseciton of two sets <span class="marked">A</span> and <span class="marked">B</span> , denoted by A ∩ B,
        is the set of all objects that are members of boththe sets A and B. In symbols, it's</p>
    <p class="Equation">A ∩ B = (x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B) </p>
    <p>That is, <span class="marked">x</span> is an element of the intersection A ∩ B if and only if <span
            class="marked">x</span> is both an element of <span class="marked">A</span> and an element of <span
            class="marked">B</span>.</p>
